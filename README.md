# node.js-weather-app
My implementation of the weather app assignment from Node.js Developer's Course
   - Two versions exist:
      - weather-app.js uses the 'request' package and chained callback functions
      - weather-app-with-promises.js uses the 'axios' package and chained promises
      
   - To get help and usage info:
      - node weather-app -h
      
   - Example to get the weather for a given address:
      - node weather-app -a 15 Main St. Philadelphia, PA
